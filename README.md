# ArrayList Scores

## Due: Thur 2/15 at 11:59 PM

- Create a program called `Scores.java`
- Prompt the user for a filename
- Read in all the values in the file and store them in an ArrayList of Integers
- Print the list
- Remove the smallest element from the list
- Calculate the mean (formatted to three decimal places), median (formatted to one decimal place), max, and min of the list and print them

***Example Input:***\
scoresin.txt\
***Example Output:***\
[90, 85, 79, 98, 60, 71, 96, 96, 84, 80, 94, 74, 78, 91, 96, 75, 86, 64, 72, 91]\
Mean: 84.211\
Median: 85.0\
Max: 98\
Min: 64

**Challenge:**\
In addition to the mean, median, max, and min, calculate the mode of the list as well

***Example Input:***\
scoresin.txt\
***Example Output:***\
[90, 85, 79, 98, 60, 71, 96, 96, 84, 80, 94, 74, 78, 91, 96, 75, 86, 64, 72, 91]\
Mean: 84.211\
Median: 85.0\
Max: 98\
Min: 64\
Mode: 96
